##Simple Inventory
I personally use this system to run my business. I thought of sharing it as to give back to the community that gave me sooooo much. It uses flask.

###Respect where it's due:
* Charts.js by http://www.chartjs.org/
* Startbootstrap-grayscale by https://github.com/IronSummitMedia

###Before you use it, please consider the following:
* This is not a sophisticated system. 
* Security measures were not taken to insure safe data transactions(I use it locally)
* Json formatted files are used instead of common DB standards.
* HTML/CSS needs a bit of work.


####Data files:
Path: `app/sku/`  
Accepted SKU titles: `WH-XXXX-NNNNN`& `DS-XXXXXX-NNNNN`. Where `WH` refers to `Warehouse` and `DS` to `Drop-Shipping`. CAPS
Quantity Validation Line: `156` & `157` in `views.py`
    
   
    warehouse_products = len([ii for ii, s in enumerate(location) if 'sku_WH' in s])
	drop_shipping_products = len([ii for ii, s in enumerate(location) if 'sku_DS' in s])
